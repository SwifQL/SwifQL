# Query Preparation Architecture

This file is the sole owner of `PREP-*` rules and the detailed preparation/output contract.

## Verified preparation path

`SwifQLable.prepare(_:)` and `SwifQLable.prepareObservingUnsafeValues(_:)` enter the same library-owned recursive preparation renderer. It runtime-dispatches known concrete `SwifQLPart` types, recursively renders the internal scoped-part wrapper with a value-semantic `SwifQLRenderContext`, shares one ordered values/formatted-values collector across the selected render, assembles one internal query string, and returns prepared output from that traversal. Observation mode augments this same renderer; it is not a second part walk or a parallel SQL-generation path.

Nested `SwifQLPartArray` values and scoped expressions are traversed in order through that same renderer and dialect. Nested values and formatted values preserve the same depth-first order, with dialect array delimiters around assembled array fragments. No semantic-statement layer is part of the current approved preparation foundation; that remains the separately gated escalation boundary defined by `DIALECT-013`.

An unsafe value appends its value to `_values`, appends the dialect-formatted representation to `_formattedValues`, and emits the dialect's internal bind symbol into the query unless the selected dialect path consumes or inlines that occurrence. In observation mode, each unsafe occurrence from the selected render is recorded in traversal order as either `bound(index)` or `notBound`. A bound index is the exact zero-based index assigned by the same ordered collector and therefore corresponds to `SwifQLPrepared.splitted.values[index]`. A zero-SQL observation marker may record an explicitly consumed unsafe occurrence without changing SQL bytes or adding a bound value. The exact external bind-key syntax is owned by `DIALECT_RENDERING.md`.

Observed provenance is fail-closed. `SwifQLUnsafeValueTrace.complete` means every unsafe occurrence reachable through the selected render is accounted for by that same traversal. If a semantic hook cannot make that completeness claim, preparation still preserves the hook's exact SQL/value output but returns `.unavailable`; the renderer must not recover completeness by replaying `parts`, performing a second census, or inspecting a separately evaluated graph.

Established `Data` composition remains unchanged. Hybrid operator preparation preserves the historical PostgreSQL/MySQL behavior while supported dialects may select an explicit representation key. Duck selects the `.duck` representation; a legacy two-branch hybrid without an explicit Duck representation fails deterministically rather than silently borrowing another dialect branch.

An unknown or unhandled part falls through the current `default: return ""` branch. Adding a concrete part that needs special rendering without dispatch support can therefore silently omit SQL and is a correctness hazard.

`SwifQLPrepared.plain` replaces internal bind markers with `_formattedValues`. `SwifQLPrepared.splitted` replaces those markers with dialect bind keys and returns the resulting query with the original `_values` order. `SwifQLFormatter` only traverses an assembled query, recognizes the dialect's internal marker, and replaces each marker in traversal order; it does not inspect `SwifQLPart`, build SQL structure, or understand DSL semantics.

## Rules

### PREP-001 — Single assembly path

`prepare(_:)` is the single final part-to-SQL assembly path.

### PREP-002 — Dispatch completeness

Every newly used concrete part requiring special rendering must have defined dispatch behavior. The current unknown-part empty-string fallback is a correctness hazard, not a completeness guarantee.

### PREP-003 — Aligned order

Query-marker order, values order, and formatted-values order stay aligned through preparation, formatting, and prepared output.

### PREP-004 — Formatter boundary

`SwifQLFormatter` is post-processing only and does not build SQL structure or inspect DSL semantics.

### PREP-005 — Shared prepared outputs

Plain and splitted output derive from the same prepared query and value ordering.

### PREP-006 — No parallel pipeline

No dialect may introduce a parallel SQL-generation or binding pipeline.

### PREP-007 — Structural SQL-region frames recurse through the same renderer

The evidence-proven major-version structural composition model may place opaque statement/subquery/set-result frame parts inside `parts`. Preparation recursively renders a frame's child parts through the same `prepare(_:)` traversal and the same ordered `values` / `formattedValues` collectors. A frame must not create a second renderer, formatter, or binding pass.

Entering a nested SQL-region frame establishes a fresh statement-local `SwifQLRenderContext`, so semantic render scopes owned by the parent statement do not leak into the nested statement/set-result region. This context reset does not reset or fork the binding collectors: value collection remains one deterministic depth-first traversal across the full structural tree.

Dedicated owner-sensitive clause parts persist already-selected ownership and may derive bounded child render scopes from that stored owner. Preparation must never rediscover clause ownership by scanning earlier parts, tokens, paths, or statement history.

### PREP-008 — Unsafe-value provenance is same-render observation

`prepareObservingUnsafeValues(_:)` must observe the exact selected preparation traversal. It must reuse the same recursive renderer, dialect dispatch, render context, and ordered bound-value collector that produce its returned `SwifQLPrepared`. Observation must not evaluate the query graph a second time, replay caller `parts`, or build provenance from an independently rendered/censused graph.

### PREP-009 — Bound indices are collector indices

Every complete-trace `bound(index)` occurrence denotes the exact zero-based slot assigned by the selected render's one bound-value collector. That occurrence must correspond to `prepared.splitted.values[index]`. An unsafe occurrence that participates in rendering but does not enter the collector is `notBound`; a library-owned zero-SQL observation marker may represent that fact without changing SQL bytes or collector order.

### PREP-010 — Completeness is fail-closed

A provenance trace may be `.complete` only when the selected render accounts for every unsafe occurrence that the active rendering path can consume, inline, or bind. When an established semantic/custom rendering hook cannot provide that proof, observed preparation must preserve its exact SQL and value behavior while returning `.unavailable`. Do not infer completeness by rescanning returned SQL, replaying semantic children, or exposing mutable renderer state to extensions.
