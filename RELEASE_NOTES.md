# Unreleased / Next SwifQL 2 prerelease — Shared Semantic Values

The next SwifQL 2 prerelease will add shared civil-date, time-of-day, civil-date-time, and structural-interval values. The exact version and tag are not published yet; these APIs are not part of the published `2.0.0-beta.5.1.0` tag.

```swift
let date = PureDate(year: 2026, month: 9, day: 4)!
let time = PureTime(hour: 12, minute: 34, second: 56, nanosecond: 123_456_789)!
let dateTime = DateTime(
    year: 2026,
    month: 9,
    day: 4,
    hour: 12,
    minute: 34,
    second: 56,
    nanosecond: 123_456_789
)!
let interval = Interval(months: 2, days: -3, microseconds: 4)

SwifQL.select(date, time, dateTime, interval).prepare(.duck).plain
```

will give:

```sql
SELECT DATE '2026-09-04', CAST('12:34:56.123456789' AS TIME_NS), CAST('2026-09-04 12:34:56.123456789' AS TIMESTAMP_NS), INTERVAL '2 months -3 days 4 microseconds'
```

`PureDate` and `PureTime` model timezone-free civil values; `PureDate` supports astronomical years and explicit temporal infinity states. `DateTime` is a timezone-free civil combination with finite and explicit infinity states, not an instant or `Foundation.Date`; exact `24:00:00` canonicalizes to the next day's midnight. `Interval` preserves independent signed months, days, and microseconds plus explicit infinity states, so it is not a fixed duration or `Comparable`. `Foundation.Date` interop for `PureDate` and `DateTime` requires an explicit Gregorian `Calendar` and `TimeZone` and can fail.

All four types use the ordinary value/binding path. Automatic inference remains intentionally limited: `PureDate` maps to `.date`, `PureTime` to `.time`, and `Foundation.Date` keeps `.timestamptz`; `DateTime` and `Interval` retain `.text` fallback and should use explicit `.timestamp` or `.interval` schema types when required. Check the selected dialect's range and precision before assuming portability: MySQL uses exact-or-hard-fail rendering, Duck `TIMESTAMP_NS` has a finite physical range, and shared interval infinity is not native Duck interval infinity.

The exact next version/tag remains a separate maintainer publication decision.

# SwifQL 2.0.0-beta.5.0.0 🚀

SwifQL 2 now runs in Swift 6 language mode, with a much broader SQL surface and safer query composition.

Install it with:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/SwifQL/SwifQL",
    exact: "2.0.0-beta.5.0.0"
)
```

If you are updating an existing project, also check [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## Swift 6

SwifQL now builds in Swift 6 language mode:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:6.0
```

```swift
swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]
```

The macOS deployment target is still 10.15.

Most importantly, moving SwifQL itself to strict concurrency did not turn the query DSL into a pile of `@unchecked Sendable` conformances.

Normal query code is still normal query code:

```swift
let query = SwifQL
    .select(\User.email, \User.name)
    .from(User.table)
    .where(\User.email == "john@gmail.com")
    .orderBy(.asc(\User.name))
    .limit(10)
```

## More SQL, same SwifQL style

A lot of the SQL surface has grown without creating a second database-specific query language.

### PIVOT

```swift
let cities = Path.Table("cities")

let query = SwifQL
    .pivot(cities)
    .on(cities.column("year"), in: 2000, 2010)
    .using(Fn.sum(cities.column("population")) => "total")
    .groupBy(cities.column("country"))
    .orderBy(.desc(cities.column("country")))
    .limit(2)

query.prepare(.duck).plain
```

will give:

```sql
PIVOT "cities" ON "year" IN (2000, 2010) USING sum("population") as "total" GROUP BY "country" ORDER BY "country" DESC LIMIT 2
```

### MERGE

```swift
let target = Path.Table("merge_target")
let source = Path.Table("merge_source")

let query = SwifQL.merge(
    into: target,
    using: source,
    on: target.column("id") == source.column("id")
)

query.prepare(.duck).plain
```

will give:

```sql
MERGE INTO "merge_target" USING "merge_source" ON "merge_target"."id" = "merge_source"."id"
```

You can also build it incrementally:

```swift
SwifQL
    .merge(into: target)
    .using(source)
    .on(target.column("id") == source.column("id"))
```

and get the same query.

### COPY

```swift
let events = Path.Table("events")

let query = SwifQL.copy(
    events,
    to: "events.csv",
    options: .format("csv"), .header
)

query.prepare(.duck).plain
```

will give:

```sql
COPY "events" TO 'events.csv' (FORMAT 'csv', HEADER)
```

The same release also includes the current SQL support around SELECT analytics, JSON, nested types/values, LIST/lambda helpers, joins, set operations, star/COLUMNS, UNPIVOT, DML/RETURNING, DDL, sequences, macros, ATTACH/DETACH/USE, table/file functions, and related SQL surfaces.

The point is not a separate API for every database. The point is to keep writing the SQL idea directly in Swift and let the selected dialect render it correctly.

## Dialects

SwifQL 2 keeps the same preparation model across its built-in dialects:

```swift
query.prepare(.psql)
query.prepare(.mysql)
query.prepare(.duck)
```

and:

```swift
SQLDialect.all // [.psql, .mysql, .duck]
```

So if your own tests assumed that `SQLDialect.all` always contained exactly PostgreSQL and MySQL, update that assumption.

## Breaking change: `SwifQLable.parts` keeps real SQL regions now

This mostly affects advanced extensions that manually modify `parts`.

### Was

```swift
extension SwifQLable {
    func appendingMyFragment(_ fragment: SwifQLable) -> SwifQLable {
        SwifQLableParts(parts: self.parts + fragment.parts)
    }
}
```

### Became

When the helper means “continue this query”:

```swift
extension SwifQLable {
    func appendingMyFragment(_ fragment: SwifQLable) -> SwifQLable {
        structurallyAppending(fragment)
    }
}
```

This lets statement/subquery/set-result ownership survive copied parts, type erasure, builders, nested SQL, PIVOT/UNPIVOT, and set composition without hidden token scanning.

Ordinary SQL-shaped query call sites do not need to start manipulating structural frames.

If you do inspect them, the public representation is available:

```swift
if let frame = query.parts.first as? SwifQLStructuralFramePart {
    print(frame.region)
    print(frame.children)
}
```

## Breaking change: predefined `Fn.Name` values are immutable

### Was

```swift
Fn.Name.coalesce = .custom("my_coalesce")
```

### Became

```swift
let name = Fn.Name.custom("my_coalesce")
let fn = Fn.build(name)
```

Normal function usage does not change:

```swift
SwifQL.select(Fn.coalesce("hello", "world"))
```

## Strict concurrency: send your data, not the SwifQL graph

A `SwifQLable` query and arbitrary `[Encodable]` binds are intentionally not declared `Sendable` just to satisfy the compiler.

For actor-based database wrappers, use this shape:

```text
build/prepare SwifQL on caller isolation
        ↓
convert to your own Sendable snapshot
        ↓
send the snapshot to the actor
```

For example:

```swift
struct QuerySnapshot: Sendable {
    let sql: String
    let binds: [String]
}

actor ConnectionActor {
    func execute(_ snapshot: QuerySnapshot) {
        // execute through your driver
    }
}
```

Your real snapshot should model the actual bind types your driver accepts. A complete example is in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## `raw(_:)` fix

Static raw now uses the supplied text correctly while preserving the established route-specific spacing:

```swift
SwifQLableParts.raw("TAIL").prepare(.psql).plain
// " TAIL"

"TAIL".raw.prepare(.psql).plain
// "TAIL"
```

## Small Swift 6 changes with the same call sites

These still look exactly the same:

```swift
SwifQL
AttachOption.readOnly
CopyOption.header
CopyOption.array
CopyOption.schema
```

but they now return fresh values instead of reusing shared non-Sendable instances.

PostgreSQL date formatting also moved to instance-local state while keeping generated PostgreSQL SQL compatible.

## What is intentionally not in the current DuckDB support

This release does not claim every DuckDB administration/runtime feature.

INSTALL/LOAD, secrets, broad PRAGMA/configuration, CHECKPOINT, VACUUM/ANALYZE administration, variables, EXPORT/IMPORT DATABASE, SHOW/DESCRIBE/SUMMARIZE convenience, extension-specific SQL universes, and the generic SQL `name := expression` API remain separate future work.

## Validation

The current Swift 6.3.3 suite passes:

```text
448 tests / 42 suites
concurrency errors: 0
concurrency warnings: 0
```

The current DuckDB SQL support was also validated against DuckDB v1.5.5.

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for the actual migration steps and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the compact version history.
