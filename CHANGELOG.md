# Changelog

## 2.0.0-beta.6.0.1

This patch aligns the package minimum Swift tools floor with the validated Swift 6.3 line and runs CI on Swift 6.3.3. It introduces no SQL/API behavior changes from `2.0.0-beta.6.0.0`.

## 2.0.0-beta.6.0.0

Shared Semantic Values are now published: `PureDate`, `PureTime`, `DateTime`, and structural `Interval` use the ordinary value path and render according to the selected dialect. See [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) for examples and dialect boundaries.

## 2.0.0-beta.5.1.0

Published prerelease with unsafe-value render provenance while preserving the established preparation and binding pipeline.

## 2.0.0-beta.5.0.0

SwifQL 2 moves the package to Swift 6, expands the SQL surface, and strengthens query composition.

### Swift 6

SwifQL now uses:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:6.0
```

```swift
swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]
```

The macOS deployment target remains 10.15.

### Dialects

SwifQL 2 keeps the same preparation model across its built-in dialects:

```swift
query.prepare(.psql)
query.prepare(.mysql)
query.prepare(.duck)
```

`SQLDialect.all` now contains:

```swift
[.psql, .mysql, .duck]
```

The expanded SQL surface includes PIVOT/UNPIVOT, MERGE, COPY, table/file functions, JSON, nested types/values, LIST/lambda helpers, joins, set operations, DML/RETURNING, common DDL, sequences, macros, and ATTACH/DETACH/USE, with dialect-specific rendering where required.

Example:

```swift
let cities = Path.Table("cities")

SwifQL
    .pivot(cities)
    .on(cities.column("year"), in: 2000, 2010)
    .using(Fn.sum(cities.column("population")) => "total")
    .groupBy(cities.column("country"))
    .orderBy(.desc(cities.column("country")))
    .limit(2)
```

will give:

```sql
PIVOT "cities" ON "year" IN (2000, 2010) USING sum("population") as "total" GROUP BY "country" ORDER BY "country" DESC LIMIT 2
```

### Structural query composition

Real statement/subquery/set-result regions are now preserved inside `SwifQLable.parts`.

If you have a custom helper that means “continue this query”, migrate it from manual array concatenation:

```swift
SwifQLableParts(parts: self.parts + fragment.parts)
```

to:

```swift
structurallyAppending(fragment)
```

Normal SQL-shaped SwifQL query source remains the same wherever the old public query source did not need to change.

### Predefined `Fn.Name` values are immutable

Instead of mutating a predefined name:

```swift
Fn.Name.coalesce = .custom("my_coalesce")
```

build a custom name explicitly:

```swift
let fn = Fn.build(.custom("my_coalesce"))
```

### Strict-concurrency integration

SwifQL query/bind graphs stay intentionally non-Sendable where that is the truthful model.

For actor-based wrappers:

```text
prepare on caller isolation
→ convert to your own Sendable snapshot
→ send the snapshot across the actor boundary
```

See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for a complete example.

### Static `raw(_:)` fix

```swift
SwifQLableParts.raw("TAIL").prepare(.psql).plain
// " TAIL"

"TAIL".raw.prepare(.psql).plain
// "TAIL"
```

The static form now uses the supplied text correctly while preserving the established spacing behavior.

### Fresh predefined values

These call sites are unchanged:

```swift
SwifQL
AttachOption.readOnly
CopyOption.header
CopyOption.array
CopyOption.schema
```

but they now return fresh values instead of sharing stored non-Sendable instances.

### PostgreSQL date formatting

Date formatting is now instance-local for Swift 6 concurrency correctness. Generated PostgreSQL date SQL remains compatible.

### Validation

```text
Apple Swift 6.3.3
448 tests / 42 suites
concurrency errors: 0
concurrency warnings: 0
```

The current DuckDB SQL support was validated against DuckDB v1.5.5.

Full examples and migration details are in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) and [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

## 1.5.0

The last stable SwifQL release line for Swift 5 projects.
